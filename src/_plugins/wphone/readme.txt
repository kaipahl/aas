An upload-and-activate plugin that creates the option to use a custom admin interface designed for mobile phones including, but not limited to, the iPhone.

== Description ==

Looking to manage your WordPress install via your phone? Then the [award winning](http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers/browse_thread/thread/958c506e018681a6) WPhone plugin is exactly what you need. It creates an option while logging in to replace the default admin interface with one designed for your phone (see [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wphone/screenshots/)).

It contains two versions of the mobile admin interface:

* Rich: designed for the iPhone / iPod Touch and other phones supporting full Javascript and CSS featuring fancy AJAX and sliding menus
* Lite: a lightweight, simple version designed for all other phone types (no Javascript or anything else required)

This plugin is designed for use with the latest version of WordPress, but will work with versions 2.1 and newer.

== Installation ==

###Upgrading From A Previous Version###

To upgrade from a previous version of this plugin, delete the entire folder and files from the previous version of the plugin and then follow the installation instructions below.

###Installing The Plugin###

Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file structure intact, and then upload the plugin's folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

This should result in something very similiar to the following file structure:

`- wp-content
    - plugins
        - wphone
            | iframer.php
            | readme.txt
            | wphone.php
            | wphone_exampleplugin.php
            - includes
                | category.php
                | category-form.php
                | comment.php
                | dashboard.php
                [ ... ]
                - css
                    | wphone.css
                    | wphone-alt.css
                - images
                    [ ... ]
                - iui
                    [ ... ]
                - js
                    | wphone.js`

Then just visit your admin area and activate the plugin.

###Plugin Usage###

When logging into your account, check the checkbox marked "Use mobile admin interface" on the login form to use the mobile admin interface.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I switch between the lite and rich versions? =

Currently, it's automatic. If your phone's browser supports Javascript and has `webkit` in it's user agent, you get the rich version, otherwise you get the lite version.

= Does this plugin support other languages? =

Yes, it does. The plugin is completely translatable. Included in the `localization` folder is the translation template you can use to translate the plugin. See the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) for details.
